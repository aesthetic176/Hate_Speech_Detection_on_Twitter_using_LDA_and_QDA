# Twitter Hate Speech Analysis Using LDA and QDA

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Twitter Hate Speech Analysis" project. This repository is dedicated to exploring and analyzing hate speech on Twitter using advanced data science techniques.

## About the Project
This project focuses on identifying and differentiating between hate speech and non-hate speech on Twitter. We employ Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) methods to analyze tweets and detect patterns of hate speech. The goal is to contribute to policy reforms and increase awareness about responsible social media use by providing insights into online communication.

## Key Components
- **Dataset**: Utilizes a comprehensive collection of Twitter messages, aiming to differentiate between friendly and offensive tweets.
- **Methodology**: Involves dataset preprocessing and classification using LDA and QDA techniques.
- **Results**: Showcases the effectiveness of LDA over QDA in accurately classifying tweets, with a focus on precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Objectives
- To investigate Twitter chats and analyze tweets for hate speech.
- To facilitate a better understanding of online communication dynamics.
- To leverage findings in early detection of hate speech.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Explore the code and datasets.
- Feel free to contribute or use the findings for academic or research purposes.

## Contributing
Your contributions are welcome! Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or someone interested in social media dynamics, your insights can help enhance this project.

Thank you for visiting this repository. Let's work together towards a more respectful digital world!
